### Purpose

The system is an online geosocial networking application that focuses on matching together users for the purpose of ad-hoc organised martial arts competition. It allows users to create a fighter profile, carefully browse through other profiles from the same geographical location and challenge them to a contest at an agreed upon location and date. Using these fighter profiles, FightApp enables users to consentually engage in friendly competition with opponents that they decide are a good competitive fit. They also can date other fighters whom they find attractive with our built in dating feature.
